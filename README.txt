This Python script is meant to convert a folder containg .npz files to .mat files so the user can use data stored as .npz files in MATLAB.

Directions:
 1. Make a folder containing only the .npz files that you want to convert to .mat. 
 2. Determine the local path of this folder and copy it to clipboard (eg. C:\Users\username\npzData\ --If you use this path, replace username with your username on your PC.)
 3. Open file_converter_npz2mat.py in an IDE, run, and paste path for folder containing .npz data when prompted to.
 4. After running, new .mat files of your data will populate in your IDE's current path folder
